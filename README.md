# LinearRegression
Hello people, I've completed the Prediction using Supervised ML task under GRADUATE ROTATIONAL INTERNSHIP PROGRAM (GRIP) by the Sparks Foundation. In this project I used 
sklearn.linear_model library to predict the scores of students using Linear Regression.

My task is to:
1]Predict the percentage of an student based on the no. of study hours.

2]this is a simple linear regression task as it involves just 2 variables.

3]You can use R,Python, SAS Enterprise Miner or any other tool.

4]Data can be found at https://bit/ly/w-data

5]what will be predicted score if a student studies for 9.25 hrs/day?
